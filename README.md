Welcome to my button animations!
In this project, I created and uniquely animated 3 seperate buttons using CSS animations.

1) Floating animation:
   A red rose colour palette was chosen due to the intense contrast of the colours to make the button stand out (extremely proud of the floating effect).
2) Shrinking and growing animation:
   Bright pink button with complementary colours featured as font colour and border. 
3) Glowing animation:
   By creating a growing and shrinking shadow around the button, a glowing effect was simulated. The autumn colour palette with warm tones stands out beautifully against the bright shadow.
